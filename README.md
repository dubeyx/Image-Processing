<b>Lab -2 </b>

Questions

1. Perform translation, scaling and rotation on an image
2. In a coloured image perform affine transformation
3. In a coloured image extract all R,B and G Perform smoothing (moving avg) on a given image. 
In one case pad rows and columns.
In 2nd case dont allow any extra rows or columns, i.e. do padding in such a way
4. Perform gaussian and compare w moving avg by extracting a small patch
5. Perform median filter on an image
6. If we increase the dimension of a filter, how will it impact the output image?

Questions

Q1. Apply the prewitt and sobel filters on random image (that have fews edges), and compare the result with original image. 
Q2. Increase the weight at positions [x,y+1], [x+1,y], [x-1,y], [x, y-1] in 3*3 sobel filter, and infer how it will impact the edge image concerning the benchmark sobel. 
Q3. Apply the LOG filter on the same image that you have taken in Q2, and compare the edge results with output of Q2.
